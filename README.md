# portfolio

The purpose of this project was to write a brand-new HTML code with an attached CSS stylesheet for a website that contains my Personal Portfolio. The website should have a Bio section, a Portfolio section with titled images linking to the live deployed websites, and a Contact section. The links in the header should scroll to the appropriate pages on the website. All of this has been implemented. 

The only thing I had a great deal of difficulty with was getting the first image (for the "Run Buddy" website) to be larger than the other three. At first I had the images in a flex-row, but I transferred them over to a grid in an attempt to solve this issue, but was still not successful, even after adjusting the width, height, alignment, float,positioning, etc. for this image. That being the case, I am out of time and am turning in the project as is in hopes that this will not affect my grade too adversely. 

It should also be noted that there will be a distinct lack of commits in this repo. I have been in contact with Will, one of my TAs, for the past couple of days, trying to resolve this issue. There is a disruption in the Git workflow but I have not been able to resolve it after many hours of attempting to. I know this will also negatively impact my grade but again, I am out of time.
